\section{Task 1 -- Test Plan}

\paragraph{Instructions}\label{task-1-instructions}
from the course Wiki\cite{1dv600:lab3:instructions}:

\begin{quote}
  To get an overall structure to test, the first task is to create a test plan.
  Use the discussion in the lectures for a structure and additionally get some
  inspiration from http://epf.eclipse.org/wikis/openup/ ­­ you will not find a
  template as such there, but lots of information on what you need to include.
  You can also use other sources for inspiration and search for templates, as
  long as they seem to be valid. Make use of your requirements from the
  previous assignment and possibly additional material from Assignment 2. Don’t
  forget that the quality requirements will require a special treatment.
  Identify objectives, objects and create a work breakdown structure using test
  management processes, dynamic test processes, and possibly static processes
  for objects and objectives. Specify suitable techniques for testing in the
  processes you have identified. Write down your reflections on creating a test
  plan with about 100 words.
